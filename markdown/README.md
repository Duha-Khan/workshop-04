# Workshop 4

By: Duha Khan

## Emphasis

The gunshot echoed, a stark interruption in the early morning quiet. *Officer Leroy* turned sharply, heart pounding in his chest, knowing that a life might have just been *irrevocably* altered. In the square, faces emerged from windows, all drawn to the sudden burst of violence that intruded upon their morning routines.

## Strong

He sprinted toward the **source** of the sound, his polished shoes pounding against the cobblestone street. A thin veil of mist still clung to the air, distorting the scene ahead. Near the fountain at the center of the square, a man lay sprawled on the ground, a crimson stain spreading across his ivory shirt. A revolver, still warm from discharge, rested just inches from his **outstretched** fingers.
